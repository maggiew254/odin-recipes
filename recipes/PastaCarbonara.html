        <li> 3 tablespoons salt </li> 
        <li> 4 oz. bacon or pancetta </li>   
        <li> 2 oz. Parmesan cheese </li>
        <li> 4 large egg yolks </li>    
        <li> 2 large eggs </li>   
        <li> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil </li>

    </ul>

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <h4> Makes 4 servings </h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Heat 6 qt. water in a large pot over high. When water starts to steam, add 3 Tbsp. salt and cover pot with a lid.</li>
        <li> Remove 4 oz. bacon from packaging and cut into about 1x¼" strips. </li>
        <li> Finely grate 2 oz. cheese and set aside one-quarter of cheese for later. </li>
        <li> Whisk 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs in a medium bowl until no streaks remain, then stir in remaining grated cheese. </li>
        <li> Add several cranks of pepper and set aside. </li>
        <li> heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large heavy pot over medium. </li>
        <li> Add bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp around the edges, 7–10 minutes. </li>
        <li> Remove pot from heat. Using a wooden spoon, fish out bacon and transfer to a small bowl. </li>
        <li> Pour fat into a heatproof measuring cup, then add back about 3 Tbsp. to pot. </li>
        <li> Cook 1 lb. pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally. Just before pasta is done, scoop out 1¾ cups of pasta cooking liquid. </li>
        <li> Add 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid to pot and bring to a boil over medium-high. Drain pasta in a colander, then transfer to pot. </li> 
        <li> Cook pasta, stirring constantly, until al dente and water is reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat.</li>
        <li> Whisk ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid into reserved egg mixture, then very slowly stream into pot, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and egg is thickened to form a glossy sauce.</li>
        <li> Mix in bacon and top with pepper and reserved cheese.</li>
    </ol>
